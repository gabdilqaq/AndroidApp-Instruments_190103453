Hello, in this application I have created different features.
First feature is changing the language.
Second feature is moving to another activity with message. I did this using the intent and putExtra() method.
Third feature is timer. The peculiarity of the timer is that it is not stop when we rotate the screen. So, it was done by activity lifecycle methods and handler.
4th feature is practicing different views.
5th feature is practicing ListActivity(Contacts).
